## `typesOutputPath` option for GraphQL Typegen

We saw great adoption of the GraphQL Typegen feature we've added in the [4.15 Release](/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.15/#graphql-typegen). We've heard that the location of the automatically generated TypeScript definitions file should be configurable. By default, it's generated in the `src/gatsby-types.d.ts` location.

You're now able to specify the location of the generated types using the `typesOutputPath` option. The `graphqlTypegen` option accepts both a boolean and an object now. If you don't pass an object (but `graphqlTypegen: true`), the default value for each option will be used.

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  graphqlTypegen: {
    typesOutputPath: `gatsby-types.d.ts`,
  },
}
```

The path is relative to the site root, in the example above the file would be generated at `<root>/gatsby-types.d.ts`. For more details and any future options, see the [Gatsby Config API](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/#graphqltypegen).

## Server Side Rendering (SSR) in development

Shortly before v4 release, we disabled [DEV_SSR flag](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/28138) because `getServerData` was not properly handled. In this release, we handled `getServerData` properly and restored the flag. Now you can add the `DEV_SSR` flag to your `gatsby-config` file so you can spot and fix SSR errors (like trying to access the window object) during development.

## Open RFCs

We continue to have ongoing RFCs that weâ€™d like your input on. Please give it a read, if applicable a try, and leave feedback!

- [Support for MDX v2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068): We are updating `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to be compatible with MDX v2. Keep a look out in the discussion for a canary to try!
- [Metadata Management API](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35841): We will be adding a built-in metadata management solution to Gatsby. Work is in progress and you can try out the canary now!
