## JavaScript and CSS bundling performance improvements

We are constantly on the hunt for ways to make Gatsby faster and more reliable, and in this release we made a change that saw a **39% speed increase** in building production JavaScript and CSS bundles.

This was possible by ensuring that we only polyfill required modules based on your browserlist. For full details see [PR #35702](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35702).

## Incremental builds performance improvements

Continuing the performance trend, we also adjusted the way we generate our content digest, resulting in fewer changed nodes and invalidated queries.

In our test case we found invalidated queries were reduced from **40k to 6k**, dramatically speeding up incremental builds. See [PR #33671](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/33671) for complete details.

## Open RFCs

We continue to have ongoing RFCs that weâ€™d like your input on. Please give it a read, if applicable a try, and leave feedback!

- [Support for MDX v2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068): We are updating `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to be compatible with MDX v2. Keep a look out in the discussion for a canary to try!
- [Metadata Management API](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35841): We will be adding a built-in metadata management solution to Gatsby. Work is in progress and you can try out the canary now!
